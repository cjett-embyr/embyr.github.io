# IBM Expands Watson into Cybersecurity Amid Corporate and Government Interest

IBM’s advanced AI, Watson, has won Jeopardy multiple times and is currently working on finding better treatments for patients with cancer, but now Watson is going to be used as an advanced cybersecurity advisor and analyst for the government and corporations alike. Watson will be used to analyze millions of documents and terabytes of data to discover errors or other inconsistencies that a roomful of human analysts might not see. After analysis Watson creates a report detailing all potential threats and vulnerabilities on that specific network. By allowing Watson to do all of the “heavy lifting” instead of a human, companies can be assured that their data is secure much sooner and with greater certainty on the accuracy of the network sweep. Watson for cybersecurity utilizes AI machine learning to remember the results of previous network sweeps and apply its finding to improve its capabilities. The primarily targeted buyer of this advanced security service is large corporations or the government, due to the number of attacks the networks of each entity experience on a regular basis. Alex Konrad, a writer for Forbes, writes that one of the IBM representatives he interviewed said that a customer tested Watson head to head with traditional methods, and “discovered attacks on 34 of the company’s laptops [while to] the security analyst without Watson’s data, the results looked like a false positive.” President Trump’s administration has made an investment in cybersecurity one of its major goals, enlisting former New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani an advisor to President Trump on the issue. As a result of this goal President Trump has already signed one executive order (33) calling for improving the critical cyber-infrastructure of the nations primary systems. In addition to executive order 33, he has also issued a memorandum elevating the U.S. Cyber Command from a sub-Unified Combatant Unit of the NSA to a full Unified Combat Command concentrating cybersecurity issues under one division. IBM hopes that as a result of the Trump administration's dedication to cybersecurity, his administration will look to IBM as a business partner in enhancing the security architecture of the U.S. government and its respective divisions.
