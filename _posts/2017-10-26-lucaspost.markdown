LUCAS YOU SHOULD WRITE YOUR POST HERE

empty line before more words means 'new paragraph', otherwise try not to
go longer than 80 characters. For example, everything that I'm typing now will
be put on the same line, and wrapped according to browser width.


this is how you do hyperlinks:

[jekyll-gh]:   https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll
[jekyll-talk]: https://talk.jekyllrb.com/
